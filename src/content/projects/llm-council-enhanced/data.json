    "overview": "AI Advisory Board is a sophisticated decision-support system that leverages a council of diverse Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide balanced, multi-perspective answers. Inspired by the work of Andrej Karpathy, this independent project features an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + Dense) and query rewriting.\n\nThe system operates in three stages: Collect (gathering independent responses), Rank (peer review among models), and Synthesize (creating a final consensus). It also includes a robust Cost Governance module for session budgeting and real-time tracking.",
    "myRole": "I architected and developed the entire system, including the FastAPI backend and React frontend. Key contributions include:\n- Designing the 3-Stage Council Process (Collect, Rank, Synthesize).\n- Implementing the Hybrid RAG system using ChromaDB and Reciprocal Rank Fusion.\n- Building the Cost Governance system with session budgets and intelligent routing.\n- Creating a responsive UI with real-time Chain of Thought display.",

        "Deployed a fully functional multi-agent system with sub-second retrieval latency.",
        "Integrated state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro) via OpenRouter.",
        "Achieved significant cost savings via budget-aware routing policies.",
        "Implemented a transparent 'Tool Steward' system for verifiable external tool usage."
