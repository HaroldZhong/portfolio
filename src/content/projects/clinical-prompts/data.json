  "overview": "This project translates expert psychiatric and care-planning workflows into structured, reliable prompts for AI systems used in clinical settings. The work involves converting implicit clinical knowledge into explicit prompt templates with standardized variable libraries, safety constraints, and formatting rules that ensure consistent, appropriate outputs for downstream healthcare applications.",
  "myRole": "As prompt engineer and system designer, I work directly with clinical experts to understand their workflows and decision-making processes. I design prompt templates with standardized variable libraries, establish safety and formatting rules, and create JSON-based structures for easy integration with existing clinical systems. I also develop validation processes to ensure prompts produce clinically appropriate outputs while maintaining HIPAA compliance and patient safety standards.",
