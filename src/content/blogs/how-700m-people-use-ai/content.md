# How 700M+ People Are Really Using AI: OpenAI vs Anthropic

Recently, both OpenAI and Anthropic released major research on how people actually use AI in the real world.

- OpenAI's study was published as an NBER working paper, using usage data from more than **700 million weekly ChatGPT users** (around 1 in 10 people globally). It's one of the first large-scale looks at what people actually do with a general-purpose chatbot.  

  - Paper: ["The Global Diffusion of Generative AI"](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34255/w34255.pdf)

- Anthropic's latest **AI Economic Index** (third update) analyzes millions of Claude conversations, links them to the O*NET task database, and adds new views on country/region differences and enterprise API use.

Together, they offer a rich snapshot of how AI is landing in both **everyday life** and **workflows**.

## 1. Different lenses on AI usage

**Anthropic** focuses on work: it maps Claude conversations to economic activities and asks whether AI is **augmenting** human work or **automating** tasks.

**OpenAI** looks across all use cases: work, learning, personal tasks, curiosity, and more, capturing how AI shows up in everyday life beyond the workplace.

In short:

- Anthropic → zooms in on **workflows**

- OpenAI → zooms out to **daily life**

## 2. From "work tool" to "life assistant"

OpenAI's data shows a clear shift over time:

- Early users were much more likely to use ChatGPT for work.

- Today, a large majority of consumer usage is **non-work** (roughly 70–73% of messages), with only about 27–30% clearly work-related.

This suggests that AI is evolving from a **professional tool** into an **everyday assistant** used for:

- learning and tutoring,

- writing and translation,

- life admin and practical guidance.

Newer users are even less likely than early adopters to use ChatGPT primarily for work, reinforcing the trend toward **mass consumer adoption**.

## 3. Automation vs augmentation at work

Anthropic highlights two core modes of AI use:

- **Augmentation** – AI as a co-pilot that helps people think, draft, or iterate.

- **Automation** – AI independently completes tasks with limited human oversight.

Their latest findings suggest that automation-heavy use cases are **growing**, enabled by improvements in model reasoning and accuracy. At the same time, augmentation remains critical for complex, collaborative, and high-stakes tasks.

Industry patterns:

- Usage is rising in **research-heavy fields** like science, education, and math.

- Some **business analysis and consulting** use cases show relative decline, possibly reflecting Claude's strengths in reasoning, coding, and technical work.

## 4. The geography of AI adoption

The Anthropic index also points to clear geographic and economic divides:

- **Richer countries and tech hubs** show higher AI adoption.

- Within the US, states with **higher education levels and more tech workers** (e.g., Washington, Utah, California, North Carolina) are ahead of the national average.

This mirrors long-standing findings in economic geography: advanced regions tend to adopt new technologies faster, which can widen existing inequalities if not addressed.

## 5. What enterprises actually do with AI APIs

Anthropic's inclusion of enterprise API usage offers a rare window into company behavior:

- Around **44%** of calls are for **programming tasks** (code generation, refactoring, debugging).

- Around **15%** are tied to **office automation** (workflow optimization, documentation, routine tasks).

Compared with consumer usage, enterprises lean more heavily toward **automation**, driven by efficiency, cost savings, and scalability.

## 6. OpenAI's behavioral insights

OpenAI's paper and related blog highlights a few broad patterns in ChatGPT interactions:

- The dominant interaction type is **asking questions** (information, advice, explanation).

- The next major type is **doing tasks** (writing, coding, editing).

- Purely emotional or expressive conversations are a small minority.

Age and cohort also matter: younger users use ChatGPT heavily but not always for formal work, while some older users are more likely to connect it directly to their job tasks.

## 7. Why this matters

Taken together, these studies show that:

- AI has moved well beyond niche expert tooling into **mainstream consumer use**.

- Adoption is **uneven across regions, sectors, and user groups**, which could reshape existing inequalities.

- Enterprise and individual behavior are diverging: companies focus on **automation and efficiency**, while individuals often look for **augmentation, learning, and guidance**.

As more local ecosystems (including China's) build their own large language model infrastructure, **behavior-level studies on local users** will be critical. They can help policymakers, companies, and educators understand:

- who benefits from AI,

- who is being left behind,

- and where we need targeted interventions to avoid a new "AI divide."
